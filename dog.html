        <h3>How Stray Dogs come to life</h3>
        <p>The domestic dog is member of the Canis genus, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. It is the first domesticated specie and has been selectively bread over millennia for different sensory capabilities, behaviours and physical attributes. Although their main ancestor is the wolf, dogs nowadays vary widely in shape, size and even colour, having many roles in the life of people. They are used for hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. Although they are dubbed as “man’s best friend”, their constant breeding has lead to an overpopulation of dogs.

            Many are abandoned on the streets, and due to the lack of neutering, their number on the streets increases. Even if shelters are taking care of part of them, negligent owners are still the cause of the overbreeding and spread of the stray dogs. This is a phenomenon that takes place all over the world, with approximately 3.9 million dogs that enter shelters every year in USA. It is impossible to determine how many stray dogs live in the United States, however, the average number of litters a fertile dog produces is one per year, with the average number of puppies being four to six. Many strays are lost pets who were not kept properly indoors or provided with identification. If they do not know how to return home, they can add up to the growing number of feral dogs.

            The problems stray dogs can cause, or are subjected to, range from bitten people, dogs walking freely on the streets, loud barks when dogs fight, the threat of walking into a street and facing a pack of hungry stray dogs, traffic accidents caused by dogs, dogs becoming road kill, poisoning feral dogs, endless conflicts in society regarding the actions that need to be taken.
            Whether they are stray or feral dogs, they can pose a threat to the human population that comes in contact with them.</p>

        <h3>Reality of what happens to them!</h3>
        <p> As a shelter manager, I am going to share a little insight with you all - a view from the inside, if you will. Maybe if you saw the life drain from a few sad, lost, confused eyes, you would change your mind about breeding and selling to people you don’t even know - that puppy you just sold will most likely end up in my shelter when it’s not a cute little puppy anymore. How would you feel if you knew that there’s about a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the shelter it is going to be dumped at - purebred or not! About 50% of all of the dogs that are “owner surrenders” or “strays” that come into my shelter are purebred dogs. If your pet is lucky, I will have enough volunteers that day to take him / her for a walk. If I don’t, your pet won’t get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under the kennel door and the waste sprayed out of its pen with a high-powered hose. If your dog is big, black or any of the “bully” breeds (pit bull, rottweiler, mastiff, etc) it was pretty much dead when you walked it through the front door. Those dogs just don’t get adopted. If your dog doesn’t get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full, it will be destroyed. If the shelter isn’t full and your dog is good enough, and of a desirable enough breed, it may get a stay of execution, though not for long. Most pets get very kennel protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing aggression. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment. If your pet makes it over all of those hurdles, chances are it will get kennel cough or an upper respiratory infection and will be destroyed because shelters just don’t have the funds to pay for even a $100 treatment. Here’s a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have never witnessed a perfectly healthy, scared animal being “put-down”. First, your pet will be taken from its kennel on a leash. They always look like they think they are going for a walk - happy, wagging their tails. That is, until they get to “The Room”, when every one of them freaks out and puts on the breaks when we get to the door. It must smell like death, or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there. It’s strange, but it happens with every one of them. Your dog or cat will be restrained, held down by 1 or 2 vet techs (depending on their size and how freaked out they are). A euthanasia tech or a vet will start the process. They find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal dose of the “pink stuff”. Hopefully your pet doesn’t panic from being restrained and jerk it's leg. I’ve seen the needles tear out of a leg and been covered with the resulting blood, and been deafened by the yelps and screams. They all don’t just “go to sleep” - sometimes they spasm for a while, gasp for air and defecate on themselves. When it all ends, your pet's corpse will be stacked like firewood in a large freezer in the back, with all of the other animals that were killed, waiting to be picked up like garbage. What happens next? Cremated? Taken to the dump? Rendered into pet food? You’ll never know, and it probably won’t even cross your mind. It was just an animal, and you can always buy another one, right? I hope that those of you that have read this are bawling your eyes out and can’t get the pictures out of your head. I do everyday on the way home from work. I hate my job, I hate that it exists and I hate that it will always be there unless people make some changes and realize that the lives you are affecting go much farther than the pets you dump at a shelter. Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you can stop it. I do my best to save every life I can but rescues are always full, and there are more animals coming in everyday than there are homes. My point to all of this is DON’T BREED OR BUY WHILE SHELTER PETS DIE! Hate me if you want to - the truth hurts and reality is what it is. I just hope I maybe changed one person's mind about breeding their dog, taking their loving pet to a shelter, or buying a dog. I hope that someone will walk into my shelter and say “I saw this thing on craigslist and it made me want to adopt”. That would make it all worth it.

            Until there are none ... rescue one."

            Better to light a candle for one lost animal
            than to curse the darkness of man's indifference.
            Saving just one animal won't change the world
            but it surely will change the world for that one animal.
